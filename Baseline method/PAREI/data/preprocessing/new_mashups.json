That's where HangoutLater comes in. When you checkin somewhere, HangoutLater notifies you on Foursquare that one or more of your friends have checked in close by recently.

    "description": "UPCZilla is a search engine for UPCs (universal product codes), based on the Storeminator (https://www.programmableweb.com/mashup/storeminator) mashup code. It leverages the web services of Amazon, eBay and Commission Junction to search for likely matches for UPCs and then aggregates the resulting data, displaying it in the form of a price comparison listing, lowest price first.\nThe engine runs as a Wordpress plugin for ease of deployment and employs multiple layers of caching (database and flat-file HTML) to maximize site speed. However, most page refreshes will require cached data to be refetched from one or more web service - maximum cache time is between one hour and 12 hours, due to restrictions on caching imposed by web service providers.\nStill, the results are very consistent, only limited by the accuracy of UPC data provided by third parties - at an estimate, less than 1% of UPC searches have products with wrongly-allocated UPCs.",

With an average charge for each ED encounter approaching $700 vs. the average physician office charge of $150, every patient redirected away from the ED saves the payor $550. This represents a total potential market savings of $34 billion for facilitating correct use of primary care.\nProviding people with the tools they need to find appropriate care everywhere saves everyone, hospitals and patients, money and time.\nPatients receive a SMS from triage.me post emergency room discharge. By sending a text to triage.me with their problem and current address, we route the person towards the nearest clinic, providing the address and a link to directions (for smartphone users).\nMany clinics that work with the underinsured also often have variable hours and locations. We've made it easy for these clinics to update their hours and location via SMS so that we can better route triage.me users to locations.",

If both users say \"yes\", the connection stays open and they can talk on MiniDat.es for as long as they want.
